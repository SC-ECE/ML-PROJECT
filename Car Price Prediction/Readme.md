##  ðŸš— Car Price Prediction

### Description:-
This project takes the parameters of an used car like: Company name, Model name, Year of Purchase, Fuel Type and Number of Kilometers it has been driven.
It then predicts the possible price of the car. For example, the image below shows the predicted prices of our Maruti Suzuki Swift & Ford Figo.

#### How this project does?
First of all the data was scraped from Quikr.com (https://quikr.com) 

The data was cleaned (it was super unclean ðŸ™‚ ) and analysed.

Then a `XGBRegression` model was built on top of it which had 0.88 R2_score.

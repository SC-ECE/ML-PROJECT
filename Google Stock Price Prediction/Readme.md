# Google Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

## Description

This is a Machine Learning Model which can predits the open values of the stock of the Google using LSTM(Long Short Term Memory Network).

### About LSTM

LTSMs are a type of Recurrent Neural Network for learning long-term dependencies. It is commonly used for processing and predicting time-series data.

LSTMs have a chain-like structure. General RNNs have a single neural network layer. LSTMs, on the other hand, have four interacting layers communicating extraordinarily.

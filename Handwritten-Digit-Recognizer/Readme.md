##  üìù Handwritten Digit Recognizer

### Description:-
MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto ‚Äúhello world‚Äù dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

In this Model, My goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images. I will create my own `CNN`(Convolutional Neural Network)
to recognize those Digits.

### Dataset :-
Run this commands to get Mnist dataset
````
from keras.datasets import mnist
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test)=mnist.load_data()
````
### Overview :-
I furthur Deployed the model in `Tinkter` . This is how it Looks
